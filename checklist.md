ðŸš¨ Still Missing (Critical for CV):


Docker Configuration - Add docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile
Screenshots - Add actual screenshots of your web interface

Essential completions (do these first):


Include the PowerBI report - Either as screenshots in the README 
Suggested enhancements to make it even stronger:

API documentation - Include example requests/responses, maybe with a simple frontend demo

Containerize the project with Docker so anyone can run it without setup headaches.
