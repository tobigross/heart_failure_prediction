üö® Still Missing (Critical for CV):

Live Demo Links - Deploy your app and add working links
GitHub Repository Link - Update the clone URL with your actual repo
Docker Configuration - Add docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile
Requirements.txt - List all Python dependencies
API Documentation - Add Swagger/OpenAPI docs link
Unit Tests - Add test coverage information
Code Quality Badges - Add test coverage, code quality badges
Performance Metrics - Add response time, throughput metrics
Your Contact Information - Replace placeholder with real links
Screenshots - Add actual screenshots of your web interface
Video Walkthrough - Record a short demo video

üéØ For Maximum CV Impact, Add:

Deployment section showing it's production-ready
Monitoring/logging implementation details
Security considerations (input validation, etc.)
Scalability notes (how it handles multiple users)
CI/CD pipeline if you have one

This README now looks much more professional and demonstrates real engineering skills that recruiters look for!


Get:
-ROC for Random forest and NN


Essential completions (do these first):

Write a comprehensive README - This is crucial. Include:

Project overview and objectives
Dataset description and source
Model performance comparison (accuracy, precision, recall)
Installation and usage instructions
Technology stack explanation


Include the PowerBI report - Either as screenshots in the README or as exported files, since this shows your data visualization skills

Suggested enhancements to make it even stronger:

Model evaluation section - Add detailed performance metrics comparison between your three models
Data preprocessing documentation - Show how you handled missing data, feature engineering, etc.
API documentation - Include example requests/responses, maybe with a simple frontend demo
Cross-validation results - Demonstrate proper ML methodology
Feature importance analysis - Show which factors most influence heart disease prediction

Recruiter / Hiring Manager Critique

    Lack of clarity on scope & performance

        As a recruiter, I can‚Äôt tell which four ML models you used, why you chose them, and how they performed.

    Business framing is thin

        Right now, it reads like a tech experiment. Employers like projects that frame a real-world problem, even if it‚Äôs hypothetical.

        Example: ‚ÄúThis tool could be used by cardiologists to quickly assess risk factors during routine check-ups.‚Äù

        README should have a ‚ÄúHow to Run‚Äù section and a diagram of the pipeline.

    Frontend looks undersold

        You mention ‚Äúsimple HTML‚Äù ‚Äî that‚Äôs fine, but recruiters might assume ‚Äúunstyled, barebones‚Äù unless you show a screenshot.

        Even basic CSS or a Bootstrap template can make it look more professional.

    Missing automation / MLOps angle

        Right now, it sounds like you run scripts manually. Even basic automation (scheduled ETL, retraining script) would look very strong.

Improvement Ideas Before Adding to Resume

    Containerize the project with Docker so anyone can run it without setup headaches.

    Make a polished README with:

        Problem statement

        Tech stack (logos help)

        Architecture diagram

        Screenshots of frontend and Power BI dashboard

        Example API calls

    Mention ethical considerations ‚Äî predicting health conditions has privacy implications; showing awareness of this makes you stand out.
