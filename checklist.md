- [ ] API:
  - [ ] FastAPI-Inputstruktur
  - [ ] Beispiel-Request

## 5. Weiterentwicklung

- [x] Trainiere alternative Modelle (LogReg, XGBoost, etc.)
- [ ] Hyperparameter-Tuning mit GridSearch oder Optuna
- [ ] Feature Importance mit SHAP anzeigen


Essential completions (do these first):

Write a comprehensive README - This is crucial. Include:

Project overview and objectives
Dataset description and source
Model performance comparison (accuracy, precision, recall)
Installation and usage instructions
Technology stack explanation


Include the PowerBI report - Either as screenshots in the README or as exported files, since this shows your data visualization skills

Suggested enhancements to make it even stronger:

Model evaluation section - Add detailed performance metrics comparison between your three models
Data preprocessing documentation - Show how you handled missing data, feature engineering, etc.
API documentation - Include example requests/responses, maybe with a simple frontend demo
Cross-validation results - Demonstrate proper ML methodology
Feature importance analysis - Show which factors most influence heart disease prediction

Recruiter / Hiring Manager Critique

    Lack of clarity on scope & performance

        As a recruiter, I can’t tell which four ML models you used, why you chose them, and how they performed.

        Include performance metrics (accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC) for each model so I can see your ability to evaluate trade-offs.

    Business framing is thin

        Right now, it reads like a tech experiment. Employers like projects that frame a real-world problem, even if it’s hypothetical.

        Example: “This tool could be used by cardiologists to quickly assess risk factors during routine check-ups.”

    Code quality is unknown

        On a resume, I’d want to see a GitHub link with a clean repo structure:

        /etl
        /models
        /api
        /frontend
        /reports
        README.md
        requirements.txt
        docker-compose.yml (optional but great)

        README should have a “How to Run” section and a diagram of the pipeline.

    Frontend looks undersold

        You mention “simple HTML” — that’s fine, but recruiters might assume “unstyled, barebones” unless you show a screenshot.

        Even basic CSS or a Bootstrap template can make it look more professional.

    Missing automation / MLOps angle

        Right now, it sounds like you run scripts manually. Even basic automation (scheduled ETL, retraining script) would look very strong.

Improvement Ideas Before Adding to Resume

    Add hyperparameter tuning & feature importance (as you plan) — but also document the impact.

    Show a comparison table of the four models, including metrics and training times.

    Include an architecture diagram of the pipeline — recruiters and hiring managers love visuals.

    Containerize the project with Docker so anyone can run it without setup headaches.

    Deploy a demo (e.g., on Render, Heroku, or Hugging Face Spaces) so people can test it live.

    Make a polished README with:

        Problem statement

        Tech stack (logos help)

        Architecture diagram

        Screenshots of frontend and Power BI dashboard

        Example API calls

    Mention ethical considerations — predicting health conditions has privacy implications; showing awareness of this makes you stand out.
